Simple Library App
This is a basic, client-side web application designed to demonstrate fundamental library management functionalities, including adding, updating, and deleting book records. It serves as a simple front-end interface, managing data directly within the browser's memory using JavaScript.

ðŸ“š Features
Add New Books: Easily add new book entries with a title, author, and publication year.

View All Books: Displays a list of all added books in a clear, tabular format.

Edit Existing Books: Select a book from the list to populate the form for quick updates.

Delete Books: Remove unwanted book entries from the list.

Real-time Updates: The book list updates instantly with each action.

Responsive Design: Styled with Tailwind CSS to be viewable on various screen sizes.

ðŸš€ How to Use
To run this application, you only need a web browser.

Save the Code: Copy the entire HTML code into a plain text file.

Name the File: Save the file as index.html (or any other name ending with .html).

Open in Browser: Double-click the index.html file. It will open in your default web browser.

You can then interact with the app directly in your browser.

ðŸ’» Technologies Used
HTML: For the basic structure and content of the web page.

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling and responsive design.

JavaScript: For handling all application logic, including data management (in-memory array), form interactions, and dynamic updates to the display.

ðŸ’¡ Future Improvements
This project currently uses an in-memory JavaScript array to store data, meaning all data is lost when the page is closed or refreshed. For a more robust application, future improvements could include:

Backend Integration: Connect the front-end to a real database (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or MongoDB) using a backend language (e.g., Node.js, Python/Flask, Ruby on Rails) to persist data.

User Interface Enhancements: Add more advanced filtering, sorting, and search functionalities.

Validation: Implement more comprehensive input validation and error handling.

User Authentication: Add user login and registration features.
